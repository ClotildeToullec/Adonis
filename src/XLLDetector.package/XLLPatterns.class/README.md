Patterns are used to search for specific code in the model. We're using MoTion to describe each poattern.
We have JavaPatterns that could be used for GWT and JDBC, XML patterns that can be used for any XML configuration file, or even HTML files, and we have patterns for SQL.

We tried to preserve the abstraction of patterns in order to preserve the concept of interoperability.
